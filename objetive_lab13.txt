Generate code for:
- Function invocation (function definition has already been implemented in laboratory 10)
- The return statement
Very important: Your compiler must be able to compile big-input.txt and input.txt (the files cannot be changed), and you *must* bring the files to the exam. The output code generated must run in MAPL with no errors or warnings.
